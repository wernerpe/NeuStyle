The above sample uses a [teddy bear mesh by hectopod](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/teddy-bears-e84b12b4ac20402aaf4d40f2219cd0e2), which is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Running the Code

To run our code, use the VS Code launch configuration in the `.vscode` folder or use the scripts in the `results` folder. These may have to be modified slightly to run correctly.
